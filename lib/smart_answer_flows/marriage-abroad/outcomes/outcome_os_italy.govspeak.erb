    You’ll be asked to provide a ‘Nulla Osta’ by the authorities in Italy. This is a certificate that proves you’re allowed to marry.

      ###Getting a statutory declaration

      While you’re waiting for your CNI, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/). The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

    ###Legalisation and translation

    You’ll need to get your statutory declaration and CNI ’[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).

    You’ll also need to get your CNI [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) and sworn before the Italian courts or an Italian Justice of the Peace.

    To get a Nulla Osta, you’ll first need to post notice of your intended marriage at the British Embassy in Rome.

    ###Applying for a Nulla Osta

    <%= render partial: "download_and_fill_notice_and_affidavit_but_not_sign.govspeak.erb" %>

    You and your partner will need to provide supporting documents, including:

      - your passport
      - your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
      - a utility bill, bank statement, official residency certificate, or driving license showing your name and Italian address (if you don’t normally live in <%= country_name_lowercase_prefix %> you can show a flight ticket or boarding pass with your date of entry or evidence of your hotel check-in)
      - evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

  <% end %>
  <% if resident_of != 'uk' %>
    <%= render partial: 'consular_cni_os_not_uk_resident_ceremony_not_germany.govspeak.erb' %>

    You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.


    ^If you’re a woman you must wait 300 days after divorcing or the death of your husband before remarrying.^

  <% end %>
  <% if resident_of == 'ceremony_country' %>

    ###What happens next

    They’ll display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

    The British embassy will issue your CNI within 5 working days (as long as nobody has registered an objection). You can collect your CNI in person or have it delivered by post.
