  These are the years when you paid Class 1 with your wages, Class 2 if you were self employed or Class 3 if you paid voluntary contributions. <%= carer_hint_for_women %> Enter 0 if you haven’t paid National Insurance contributions. National Insurance credits will be automatically added for ages between 16 and 19 years old (if you’re eligible) - you don’t have to count them.
