    However, you should bring the [same documents](/government/publications/visitor-visa-guide-to-supporting-documents) you'd need to apply for a visa, to show to officers at the UK border.

    ^ If the bio data page in your passport doesn't include a personal ID number, you should apply for a [Visitor in Transit](/transit-visa) visa.

    ## Transiting without a visa

    Even if you don't have a personal ID number, you might be eligible for the 'transit without visa concession' if:

    - you arrive and depart by air

    - have a confirmed onward flight which leaves within 24 hours

    - have the correct documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)

    ^ The 'transit without visa concession' is decided by the immigration officer at the border. You won't be allowed to transit if they decide you need a visa, so you might want to apply for a transit visa before you travel.
