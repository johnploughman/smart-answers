  Use the calculator to agree on a child maintenance amount if [you’re arranging it yourselves](/arranging-child-maintenance-yourself), or to get an idea of the statutory amount the government would work out for you (including collection and application fees).

  Don't use the calculator if you have a ['1993 scheme' or '2003 scheme' case](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/child-maintenance-before-march-2003). These are managed by the Child Support Agency (CSA).

  ##What you need to know:##

  - the calculator only gives an estimate - it may not give the right result for complicated circumstances
  - you need information about the income of the parent who'll be paying
  - if you already have a case with the Child Support Agency (CSA) or the Child Maintenance Service and your circumstances have changed, [contact the office managing your case](/child-support-agency) - they’ll tell you if your child maintenance payments will change

  Check the [child maintenance rates](/how-child-maintenance-is-worked-out/how-the-child-maintenance-service-works-out-child-maintenance) before you use the calculator.
